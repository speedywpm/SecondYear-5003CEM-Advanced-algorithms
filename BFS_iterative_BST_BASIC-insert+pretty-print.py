    Here are solutions to 2 ***introductory challenges*** set in Week 4 (these solutions released in Week 5).

    CHALLENGE 1: Use Breadth First Search to find a target. Inform if found or not

    CHALLENGE 2: Find a target and delete it ONLY if it is a leaf. If is found but not a leaf, inform if has been found but cannot be deleted.
    If not found inform, i.e. target is not found.

    NOTES: BFS is tricky because it requires us to hop between levels as we do our traversal. A straightforward way of doing the
    traversal is to use a queue and enqueue and dequeue nodes as shown. Whenever a node is dequeued, this is the next value in our breadth
    first traversal. When / if the target is found, we finish - and whatever is in the queue is not considered further.

    The delete solution uses the BFS to find the target and if it is a leaf, we need to find the parent as we can only delete a child of
    a parent from a BST, never the node directly - EXCEPT the root, which can have no parent.

    These were both **challenging** tasks to get you into thinking about traversal and deletion of nodes in a BST.
